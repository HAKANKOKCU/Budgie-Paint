Budgie Paint Web And Desktop App (open index.html)
i dont know why i made this public without making it fully useable

demo : https://budgiepaint.netlify.app/

to launch it as an desktop app, you need electronJS: Run `npm install --save-dev electron` in main folder to install electron. To run it as an app use `npm start` in main folder.

This app uses bootstrap icons
